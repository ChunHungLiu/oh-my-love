* Introduction

This is a personal site for my lovely girl, it is inspired by [[https://github.com/wong2/lovegift][lovegift]].

The code contains lots of quick and dirty quirks, I'm not sure whether I have
time to make it clean and readable.

* How to run

This site is a simple rails app, you can just run it by:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-love.git oh-my-love
cd oh-my-love
bundle install
bundle exec rails server
#+END_SRC

* Internals

There're two points worth mentioning.

** Image metadatas

The main design idea is to show images on Google maps, together with some
captions to tell the story. Each image contains some metadata such as
position(ala, Google maps' latitude and longitude), date, and description. A
simple plain idea is to write these metadata in JavaScript directly, however, I
have too many images and I want more flexible code, so I decide to adopt
jQuery's =$.getJSON()= to get metadata when needed. And I didn't want to edit
JSON file directly, I prefer [[http://www.yaml.org/][YAML]], so I use a simple script to convert YAML to
JSON offline. Pick this [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-love/blob/master/public/images/lovestory/beijing/meta.yml][meta.yml]] to get an overview of the whole idea.

** Sleep function in JavaScript

Second, JavaScript didn't even contains a function called =sleep()=, so I have
to figure out some way to show a series of pictures with a series of captions
in a series of specified time. Of course you can use =window.setTimeout()=,
however, if you try you will know that you can only use =window.setTimeout()=
with a specified timer. And *JavaScript is ASYNCHRONOUS by default*, so you
need to create some [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)][Closure]]s to wrap and pass correct parameter. I'm a
JavaScript beginner, so I've tried a lot to figure out this way. If you have
better idea, do not hesitate to tell me. Thanks.
